      <h2>Welcome to the Cormasio Pet Adoption Center</h2>
      <p>
        Ours is a grass roots SPCA stitched together by concerned citizens and
        run largely by volunteers. We are not affiliated with other SPCAs and
        have our own goals. We provide our dogs and cats with shelter, freedom
        from fear and pain and all the love we can â€“ with no time limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are one of the few No-Kill SPCAs in Quebec! Help the innocent who
        cannot help themselves. Abandoned and abused pets do not ask for much.
        All they need is another chance. Each year this chance has given
        hundreds of unwanted animals a new life through our various programs
        along with successfully reuniting hundreds of lost pets with their
        owners.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not government funded and rely solely on the generosity of caring
        people like you to provide the necessary care for our animals. The cost
        of running a shelter such as ours can be astounding. We depend on our
        members to help us pay veterinarian bills, employees, renovations, food,
        kitty litter, construction material, and of course the usual monthly
        costs such as heating, phone bills, taxes, and of course, our mortgage.
