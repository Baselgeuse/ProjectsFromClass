      <h2>Cat Care</h2>
      <p>
        Have you recently added a feline friend to your family? Congratulations!
        We know you’ll be thrilled to have your new cat in your home. We
        encourage you to browse our directory of adoptable cats in your area, or
        use our shelter finder to start your search.
      </p>
      <h3>Feeding</h3>
      <p>
        We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food.
        Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and
        determine the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health
        make a difference in what and how much a cat should eat.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye
          health. The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of
          your cat or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and
          refill your cat’s water bowls daily.
        </li>
        <li>Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.</li>
        <li>
          Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea,
          vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two days.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Grooming</h3>
      <p>
        Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should
        brush or comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your
        cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the
        incidence of hairballs.
      </p>
      <h3>Housing</h3>
      <p>
        Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and
        rest. Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to
        wash the bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor cats do
        not live as long as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from
        cars, or from fights with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs.
        Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats are more likely to become
        infested with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious diseases.
