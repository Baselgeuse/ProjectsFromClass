      <h2>Dog Care</h2>
      <p>
        A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an
        experienced pet parent or a first-time adopter, it's important to keep
        your canine companion's health and happiness a top priority. Below are
        some useful tips for all dog parents.
      </p>
      <h3>Feeding</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.</li>
        <li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
        <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
        <li>
          When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually
          enough.
        </li>
        <li>
          For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's
          better to feed two smaller meals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs
        and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy
        cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these additions
        should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake. Puppies
        should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy
        foods for large breeds). Please limit "people food," however, because it
        can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems
        and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water
        should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water
        dishes frequently.
      </p>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>
        Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay
        healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix,
        sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid
        boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and
        games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd,
        chew, retrieve and chase.
      </p>
      <h3>Housing</h3>
      <p>
        Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest, away from all drafts and off
        the floor. A training crate or dog bed is ideal, with a clean blanket or
        pillow placed inside. Wash the dog's bedding often. If your dog will be
        spending a lot of time outdoors, be sure she has access to shade and
        plenty of cool water in hot weather, and a warm, dry, covered shelter
        when it's cold.
